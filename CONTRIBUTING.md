# How to Contribute?

Contributing to `sec-ai` is a rewarding way to learn and improve this open-source project. Whether you are a user looking to expand your knowledge or a developer eager to delve into the codebase, this guide is here to help you get started.

## Understanding the Workflows

Before diving into the codebase guides, we recommend setting up your environment and understanding our contribution workflow. Please visit [**Common Contributing Guidelines**](https://github.com/alphanome-ai/common-contributing-guidelines) for information on environment setup, coding standards, and contribution workflows that are common across our repositories.

## Exploring the Codebase

If you are new to `sec-ai` and would like to get started, please refer to the [**Quickstart User Guide**](https://sec-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/user_guide.html).
  
For those interested in contributing to `sec-ai`, the [**Comprehensive Developer Guide**](https://sec-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/developer_guide.html) provides an in-depth walkthrough of the codebase and offers examples to help you contribute effectively.

Both guides are interactive and allow you to engage with the code and concepts as you learn. You can run and modify all the code examples for yourself by cloning the repository and running the respective notebooks in a Jupyter environment.

Alternatively, you can run the notebooks directly in your browser using Google Colab.

> **Note**
Before contributing, we highly recommend familiarizing yourself with these guides. They will help you understand the structure and style of our codebase, enabling you to make effective contributions.
